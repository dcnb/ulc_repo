one must have a mind of winter

to regard the frost and the boughs 

of the pine trees covered with snow;

and have been cold a long time

to see the junipers shagged with ice

the spruces rough in the distant glitter

of the january sun; and not to think

of any misery in the sound of the wind, 

in the sound of the leaves,

Which is the sound of the land

Full of the same wind

That is blowing in the same bare place

For the listener, who listens in the snow, 

and nothing himself, beholds the nothing

that is not there and the nothing that is.
